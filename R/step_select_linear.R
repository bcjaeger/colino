#' Feature selection step using the magnitude of a linear models' coefficients
#'
#' `step_select_linear` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that selects
#' a subset of predictors based on the ranking of the magnitude of coefficients
#' provided by a `parsnip::linear_reg` or `parsnip::logistic_reg` model.
#'
#' @param recipe A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
#'   operations for this recipe.
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which variables are
#'   affected by the step. See selections() for more details. For the tidy
#'   method, these are not currently used.
#' @param outcome A character string with the name of the response variable to
#'   use to calculate the feature importance scores.
#' @param role Not used by this step since no new variables are created.
#' @param trained A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
#'   been estimated.
#' @param engine A supported rand_forest engine that is supported by parsnip.
#'   The default is "glm".
#' @param threshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
#'   of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
#'   retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
#'   threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
#'   mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
#'   select the top-ranked features and those that have filter scores that are
#'   larger than the cutoff value.
#' @param cutoff A numeric value where predictors with _larger_ absolute filter
#'   scores than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies that this
#'   criterion will be ignored.
#' @param penalty A non-negative number representing the total amount of
#'   regularization (specific engines only).
#' @param mixture A number between zero and one (inclusive) that is the
#'   proportion of L1 regularization (i.e. lasso) in the model. When mixture =
#'   1, it is a pure lasso model while mixture = 0 indicates that ridge
#'   regression is being used (specific engines only).
#' @param exclude A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
#'   from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
#'   should not be set by the user.
#' @param scores A tibble with 'variable' and 'scores' columns containing the
#'   names of the variables and their feature importance scores. This parameter
#'   is only produced after the recipe has been trained.
#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
#'   bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
#'   some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
#'   processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
#'   TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.
#' @param id A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.
#'
#' @return a `step_select_linear` object.
