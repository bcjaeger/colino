#' Apply minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (mRMR)
#'
#' `step_select_mrmr` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that will apply
#' minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (mRMR) to numeric
#' data. The top `top_p` scoring features, or features whose scores occur in the
#' top percentile `threshold` will be retained as new predictors.
#'
#' @param recipe 	A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
#'   operations for this recipe
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which variables are
#'   affected by the step. See selections() for more details. For the tidy
#'   method, these are not currently used
#' @param role Not used by this step since no new variables are created
#' @param trained A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
#'   been estimated
#' @param outcome A character string specifying the name of response variable
#'   used to evaluate mRMR.
#' @param top_p An integer that will be used to select the number of best
#'   scoring features.
#' @param threshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
#'   of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
#'   retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
#'   threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
#'   mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
#'   select the top-ranked features and those that have filter scores that are
#'   larger than the cutoff value.
#' @param cutoff A numeric value where predictors with _larger_ absolute filter
#'   scores than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies that this
#'   criterion will be ignored.
#' @param threads An integer specifying the number of threads to use for
#'   processing. The default = 0 uses all available threads.
#' @param exclude A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
#'   from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
#'   should not be set by the user.
#' @param scores A tibble with 'variable' and 'scores' columns containing the
#'   names of the variables and their mRMR scores. This parameter is only
#'   produced after the recipe has been trained.
#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
#'   bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
#'   some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
#'   processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
#'   TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.
#' @param id 	A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.
#' @return A step_select_mrmr object.
