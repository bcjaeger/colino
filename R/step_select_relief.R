#' Feature selection step using the Relief algorithm
#'
#' Relief-based algorithms use nearest neighbors of randomly sampled
#' observations (without replacement) to derive feature weights/scores that
#' describe the relevance of each feature to the target variable. The feature
#' weights represent the differences between the normalized feature values from
#' each randomly sampled observation and a neighboring observation. If the
#' neighboring observation's class is the same as the sampled observation
#' (termed a 'hit') but the feature values are different, then this reduces the
#' score on the basis that widely varying feature values for the same class are
#' not desirable. Conversely, if a neighboring observation's class is different
#' from the sampled observation (termed a 'miss') and the feature values are
#' different, then this increases the score on the basis that observations of
#' different classes are widely separated by their feature values. The feature
#' weights / scores range from -1 (worst) to +1 (best).
#'
#' `step_select_relief` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that selects
#' a subset of predictors based on the scores of the relief algorithm. This step
#' requires the FSinR package to be installed. The top `top_p` scoring features,
#' or features whose scores occur in the top percentile `threshold` will be
#' retained as new predictors.
#'
#' @param recipe 	A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
#'   operations for this recipe.
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which variables are
#'   affected by the step. See selections() for more details. For the tidy
#'   method, these are not currently used.
#' @param role Not used by this step since no new variables are created.
#' @param trained A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
#'   been estimated.
#' @param outcome A character string with the name of the response variable to
#'   use to evaluate information gain value against the predictors.
#' @param top_p An integer with the number of best scoring features to select.
#' @param threshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
#'   of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
#'   retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
#'   threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
#'   mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
#'   select the top-ranked features and those that have filter scores that are
#'   larger than the cutoff value.
#' @param cutoff A numeric value where predictors with _larger_ absolute filter
#'   scores than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies that this
#'   criterion will be ignored.
#' @param neighbors An integer with the number of neighbors for find for each
#'   sampled instance. Default is 5.
#' @param sample_size An integer with the number of instances to sample. Default
#'   is 10.
#' @param exclude A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
#'   from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
#'   should not be set by the user.
#' @param scores A tibble with 'variable' and 'scores' columns containing the
#'   names of the variables and their information gain scores. This parameter is
#'   only produced after the recipe has been trained.
#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
#'   bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
#'   some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
#'   processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
#'   TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.
#' @param id 	A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.
#' @return A step_select_relief object.
